PRINT GUIDE: 


Top Connection Joint x 4
Filament : PETG
Settings - Make it as strong as you want, preferably as strong as you can depending on your budget.

	Known Issues:
	- Very Prone to warping on the build plate - Print hot 

	- Hole diameter is perfect for the top holes, however the ones with an overhang are printed slightly too small, increasing hole size would mean less threaded insert 	bite, therefore the best fix will be to make separate corner pieces for each corner, TBD.

Hole Finder x 1
Filament : PLA/PETG
Settings : None

	Known Issues:


BOM:
This is the minimum amount of extra components required to assemble. 

M6 x 12mm : 48 
M6 threaded insert : 48

Changelog:

1/06/25

- Increased hole size from 7.4mm to 7.5mm to hopefully let the insert on the threaded insert actually insert before heating up and melting in.
- Added a 3mm curve to all the exterior connection blocks to test easier printing methods with less warping especially for PETG/ABS.
- Moved text 0.5mm to the right to center "Stardesigns precision"

2/06/25

- Bottom blocks were registering at 41mm instead of the required OD of 43mm causing smaller parts, and a non square fit.
